# FastArrayOps
Ultra Fast Array Operations using AVX/AVX2 code on the arrays to find Min-Max values and their array index.

### Overview

In programming, it's very common to use and deal with the arrays, especially numerical arrays, in some operations like sorting, finding minimum and maximum values and their array index. Also, in image processing routines it can be seen that finding the max-min locations of some values, such as frequency histograms, image pixel values and locations of them are very common tasks. So, it is wanted to be optimized considering multi repetations on arrays those can be very time consuming. Here, we already know how to find min and max values iterating over the arrays. Therefore, the problem actually invloves writing faster codes, especially working with large arrays, by using machine codes (SIMD codes AVX, AVX2, AVX512), parallelizm and multi-threading. Also, using generic routines may increase the productivity and decrease the coding effort. 

FastArrayOps uses the classical approach and SIMD-accelerated codes (from the project of Kareem Omar at https://github.com/komrad36) to find minimum and maximum values and their array index. Also, generic routines have been written to test different types of numeric types. Based on Kareem's SIMD code in C, object files were produced (by using ml64.exe in VS) and used in the library. Simply, four types of arrayOp classess have been implemented in FastArrayOpsAVX.pas file as below:

 type TClassicArrayMinFinder = class
 public
  class procedure ValueIndexOfMinimum<T>(const AValues: array of T; IndexOfMin: Integer; var MinVal);
 end;

 type TClassicArrayMaxFinder = class
 public
  class procedure ValueIndexOfMaximum<T>(const AValues: array of T; IndexOfMax: Integer; var MaxVal);
 end;

 type TArrayContainsValue = class
 public
  class Procedure ContainsValue<T>(const anArrayOf: Array of T; const TargetValue; var Result: Boolean);
 end;

 type TArrayMinFinder = class
 public
  class Procedure MinValue<T>(const anArrayOf: Array of T; var Result);
 end;

 type TArrayMaxFinder = class
 public
  class Procedure MaxValue<T>(const anArrayOf: Array of T; var Result);
 end;
 
TClassicArrayMinFinder and TClassicArrayMaxFinder uses classical approach to find min value-min index and max value-maxindex, respectively. The other classes are the main ones with SIMD-accelerated routines (TArrayMinFinder and TArrayMaxFinder). The project file contains some test routines and comparisons with the SIMD-accelerated routines. Please, investigate the test results on the arrays of 10000000 elements as shown below:

Found index: 18446744073709551615
Actually it should be not found(-1), Time (ms): 4
So, when it could not find the searched value, it returns high(type_of_value)
Here it returned high(uint64) which equals to: 18446744073709551615

Test FastFind-floatAVX  --> result: Found index: 4999999, should be: 4999999, Time (ms): 5

===========================================================================

Considering the results, Delphi compiled routines with classical approach slightly slower than SIMD-accelerated routines but not so much different on a huge array. Please test the codes and comment on these routines. If you have faster routines please share.
